# nurs.nvim

### About

Heavily based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) with my own customisations that were accumulated by using a bunch of other distributions at work - mainly doing web dev with React / TypeScript and occasionally Rust.

### Installation

Requirements:

- Make sure to review the readmes of the plugins if you are experiencing errors. In particular:
  - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is required for multiple [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies) pickers.

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS    | PATH                                      |
| :---- | :---------------------------------------- |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |

Clone this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nurseiit/nurs.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

The `Lazy` plugin manager will start automatically on the first run and install the configured plugins - as can be seen in the introduction video. After the installation is complete you can press `q` to close the `Lazy` UI and **you are ready to go**! Next time you run nvim `Lazy` will no longer show up.

If you would prefer to hide this step and run the plugin sync from the command line, you can use:

```sh
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```
